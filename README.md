# BookBot
A basic chat bot that uses discord.py. Not really intended for public use, but made public for reference. Integrates a number of modules that I've found useful for various server operations and functions for friends.

bookbot.py is the primary bot application, the remaining python and shell files are modules utilized by it but kept separate for organizational purposes.
